Hi there, i am a final year undergraduate student from Fudan University majoring in Electronic Engineering ( Biomedical Engineering ) . I'm an NLP enthusiast, with research interests including Natural Language Processing and Multi-modal Machine Learning. My goal is to endow machine with emotional and logical ability to understand this world and interact with human beings. 

I'm a member of [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab](http://fnlpsds.com/) (Fudan DISC) , and i am conducting research project concerning new datasets construction and new task formulation under the supervision of [Prof. Zhongyu Wei](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/)  at DISC. Besides, i conducted a research project of data augmentation with the guide from [Prof. Diyi Yang](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dyang888/) during the last summer.

I will apply for master degree at the end of 2021.
